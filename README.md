CURRENTLY BROKEN (testing in progress)

A fork of Sharandac's excellent firmware. This implimentation is adapted to work with Adam Piggz's Amazfish companion app on linux phone distros via the Bangle.js device type. Specifically by utilizing UART UUID's, the Bangle.js name, and expected services. On the Amazfish side the Bangle.js name along with service discovery returns pinetimejfdevice (as it should for Bangle.js), and it works through devicefactory.cpp.

Amazfish:
https://github.com/piggz/harbour-amazfish

Further modifications are to optimize the layout with the information provided by Amazfish. See here for further ref (https://github.com/piggz/harbour-amazfish/blob/master/daemon/src/devices/banglejsdevice.cpp)

Weather App. While the Weather App provded by Sharandac's firmware is nice, it relies on wifi to update. I have completed a weather widget that utilizes Amazfish's built in weather service messages. Visually it looks the same as the Weather app widget (maybe not as customizable). It should also work well (even better) with Gadgetbridge. Still needs some work.

Features are limited due to a limited feature set supported in Amazfish.

Currently Supported Features:
- Call notification
- Txt notification
- Email notification
- Chat app notification
- Weather notification
- Weather widget via Amazfish Weather Service message. "Stay on" MUST be enabled in the Watch firmware settings due to the method with which Amazfish sends Weather (immediately instead of caching the message and sending on connect).

Can Work, but doesn't:
- Music Control IS implimented in Amazfish, but I have little interest in fixing it to work. Maybe in the future.

Will not work unless implimented on Amazfish:
- Navigation

To Do:
- Trigger for Night icons with Weather Widget (in progress)
- Optimize BLE for Amazfish weather. Some sort of timer to set BLE to "Stay on" for a certain amount of time, then go back to just wakeups. Should help battery life since it is only 10H with "stay on" enabled which keeps it out of deep sleep.

All other features on the watch side are untouched and remain the same as with Sharandac's firmware (eg calc, IRremote, etc. Anything not wanted can be commented out/removed on compile)

DISCLAIMER: This is very much a work in progress and my coding isn't fantastic or elegant. I take no responsiility for any damage caused by you running this firmware. It shouldn't damage anything, but if you are concerned feel free to go through my code. I run this firmware myself on a TTGO T-watch 2020 v1 with Amazfish 2.0.3 on SailfishOS 4.2.

# My-TTGO-Watch

## Install

Clone this repository and open it with platformIO. Select the right env and then build and upload.
Or follow the great step by step [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUGADCnerCs) from [ShotokuTech](https://github.com/ShotokuTech).
If you are interested in native Linux support, please install sdl2, curl and mosquitto dev lib and change the env to emulator_* in platformIO.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libmosquitto-dev build-essential
```

# known issues

* the webserver crashes the ESP32 really often
* the battery indicator is not accurate, rather a problem with the power management unit ( axp202 )

# how to use
