Fork of Sharandac's firmware.

-BLE weather widget working with Weather Notification (src icons may need some tweaks). Mitigated a previous issue of multiple weather reports stacking up and changing the widget to a previous weather state. Weather message will display, upon close, or screen timeout, it is deleted. Weather widget persists.
-Beacon spam implemented.
-Deauth implemented

This is an experimental branch aimed at incorporating wifi deauth, becaon spam, and BLE weather widget in Sharandac's newly refactored repo
